# Code Work App With React Native 

## Features

- You can easily see job postings from tech companies from Web API.  
- The application shows you these job postings page by page by sending requests to 1-50 job postings in the API. 
- When you tap a card for a job posting, the app will show you the details of that job posting. 
- You can add this job to your favorites when viewing details for the job posting. The app checks to see if you've added this ad to favorites before.  
- You can easily remove a job that you've added to your favorites from your favorites.
